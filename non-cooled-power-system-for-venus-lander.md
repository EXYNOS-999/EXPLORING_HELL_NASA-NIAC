# Non-Cooled power system for Venus Lander

> The housings can be made from Titanium and ceramic,We can introduce aerogel also over here as these enclosures will have double chambers with Stirling engine or any other heat pump so that cooling air can be used to reduce the heat transfer from the ambient to the sensors keeping it around 85°C max.The enclosure can also include insulation with special glass(sapphire) or quartz (400 °C) for camera.
