> A number of experimental projects are ongoing today to show that microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) can open the door to **low-cost, high reliability, mass-produced satellites** 



> MEMS combine conventional semiconductor electronics with beams, gears, levers, switches, accelerometers, diaphragms, microfluidic thrusters, and heat controllers, all of them microscopic in size

**Accelerometer**:

* Accelerometer: an instrument for measuring the acceleration of a moving or vibrating body.

From [Live Science](https://www.livescience.com/40102-accelerometers.html)

> Smartphones and other mobile technology identify their orientation through the use of an accelerator, a small device made up of axis-based motion sensing.

* Essentially a motion sensor
* The motion sensors in the accelerometer can be used:
  * Detect earthquakes
  * Medical devices such as bionic limbs & other artificial body parts
  * Devices part of the "[quantified self movement](https://www.livescience.com/39185-quantified-self-movement.html)" use accelerometers
